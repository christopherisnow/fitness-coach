[Check out the demo](https://online-fitness-coach.netlify.app/) of what you'll get in less than 10 minutes, or [be inspired by creator stories](https://wowchemy.com/creators/).

## Notes

- To add your appointment booking services, configure your services at https://calendly.com/ and then copy the links provided by Calendly to each service which you offer in `content/home/book.md`
- By default, the CMS is disabled for demo purposes. To re-enable it, remove the `disable` line from the `modules` section of the `config.yaml` and uncomment the options in `content/admin/index.md`
- If you decide to add a Portfolio widget, remove the `require_isotope: false` line from `params.yaml` to load the Portfolio's IsotopeJS dependency
