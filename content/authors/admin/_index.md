> Through dance I claim equality between all life forms and their belonging to the natural world. I feel that my duty in this life is to share the value and beauty of performing art with both professionals and non-professionals; to regain the body â€“ knowledge that has been lost. Let s dance to celebrate and respect the multiplicity and diversity of our bodies, which together create the magic of our earthly unity.

Jadi Carboni (Bologna 1981, Bologna) is a choreographer, dancer, teacher, body-worker, practitioner of various performing arts and healing disciplines. Movement and sound are her media for communication, discovery, and creation. The practice of natural principles inspires her choreographic and teaching methods.
